To run the programs, the following programs have to be installed:
1. python 3
2. NLTK (http://www.nltk.org/install.html)
3. CRFSuite https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-crfsuite

Running the programs will create the folder "nltk_data" in C:/User directory, where the corpus files will be automatically copied to.


Containing Folders
==================

!Note: Taggers are supposed to train on the Bambara Reference Corpus Daba HTML files.

Corpus
- Should contain corpus files in Daba HTML format

Models
- folder empty, but will be used to store models to when CRFTaggers is trained

Results
- folder empty, results of analyzeContingency.py will be saved to this folder



Containing Files 
================

analyzeContingency.py 
- calculates percentage of words tagged i which are j in reality; saves result to a file in Results folder
- looks for the words which are responsible for these errors and save each error to a file in Results folder
- saves confusionmatrix to Results folder

backoffCombi.py
- combines taggers according to the backoff-chaining given in NLTK

bambara_tagging_htmlreaderALL.py
- load the corpus files and creates a reader needed to work with the sentences/words in the corpus
- used by create_reader

confusionmatrix.py
- modified version of confusionmatrix.py of NLTK
- function was added so that switches (tagger tagged word with tag A instead of tag B) can be analyzed

create_reader.py
- uses bambara_tagging_htmlreaderALL to create a reader (with htmlreaderALL.py) needed to work with the corpus files

crf.py
- modified crf of NLTK (features were added; Tag-features are possible now)

CrossValidation.py
- implementation of a 9-fold crossvalidation

disambiguation.py
- removes ambiguous tags from loaded tagged sentences (e.g. n/v)

ensemblecombinationBrillWu_Html.py
- calculates complementarity and disagreement of the taggers CRF, TnT, HMM and either Unigram or a backoff Tagger (Bigram+Affix+Dictionary+Regexp+DefaultTagger) according to Brill & Wu (1998)
- save result to files in Results folder

ensemblecombinationBrillWu_HtmlREGEX,py
- calculates complementarity and disagreement of the taggers CRF, TnT, HMM, Unigram, Regexp
- saves result to files in Results folder

htmlreaderALL.py
- reader for html files 
- itÂ´s a modified xml reader of NLTK: nltk.corpus.reader.xmldocs; uses parts of HTMLReader of Kirill Maslinsky

indivTaggers.py
- train individual taggers more easily 
- also used by other programs

patterns[_non]_tonal[_SA].py
- patterns for the RegexpTagger, see http://cormand.huma-num.fr/gloses.html 

regextagger_[non_]tonal[_SA].py
- RegexpTagger for each form of training (tonal or nontonal, with or without Affixes)

toolboxreaderRun.py
- contains function to get the alternative words to one entry in the dictionary

Voting.py
- implementation of several voting strategies for ensemble combination
